## Overview

This was my second completed challenge from Frontend Mentor. I've been learning HTML and CSS for about 6 months now, and the realistic project challenges have really helped me to get out of just element and rule memorization and into practical building.   

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned quite a bit about CSS Grid while working through this challenge. I was having a hard time getting both halfs of the card compontent to line up evenly. I had to spend a while trying to debug my CSS while reading documentation on CSS Grid and ultimately found it was a margin issue. I built 3 more of these challenges on <link href="replit.com">.

### Continued development

I enjoyed this project and it was a great way for me to learn about spacing my elements with CSS Grid and the margin property, not to mention starting with a Mobile-first workflow.
